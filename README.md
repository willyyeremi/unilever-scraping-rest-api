# Unilever Scraping: REST API v1
This project is for doing CRUD operations on scraped or processed data in the database.

## Precaution
- Set [database](https://github.com/willyyeremi/unilever-scrapper-database) first, so the API can access the data.
- Run run.bat to set up the API requirement and run main.py.
